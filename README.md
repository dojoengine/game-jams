# Dojo Game Jams

![Vibe Jam Header](.github/assets/VibeHeader.png)

‚ÄãDojo GÃ∂aÃ∂mÃ∂eÃ∂ Vibe Jam is here and starts on 6/20!!

‚ÄãJoin us for a special vibe-coding edition of the Dojo Game Jam! Teams will come together for 3 days to build games on the open-source, provable Dojo Engine, and compete for a slice of a $20,000+ prize pool.

If you‚Äôre ready to get involved and find a team, introduce yourself in the [Dojo Discord](https://discord.gg/tHezCAA4) - new contributors are always welcome. From there, the [Dojo Book](https://book.dojoengine.org/) is a great place to start your journey.

## Tracks

This Game Jam will have two tracks: full games, and game mods.

1. The **Full Game Track** is for large or existing teams who want to ship full games or major features.
2. The **Modding Track** is for small teams and solo devs who want to get their feet wet by modding existing games.


## Prizes

üèÜ We have a $20,000 prize pool (and growing!) to award to projects in the two tracks. 2/3 of the pool to the full game track, and 1/3 to the modding track.

Please note: there will be **no airdrops** for participation in the Game Jam.
Prizes will only be awarded to teams that build excellent projects that demonstrate the unique capabilities of the Dojo engine.
