Feel free to grab an idea off the list!

## Tutorials

If you're new to Dojo development, the [Dojo Book](https://book.dojoengine.org/) is a great place to start your Dojo development journey.

To learn more about Dojo's new Sensei MCP server and to get started, check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/dojoengine/sensei-mcp/blob/main/README.md).
See [here](https://github.com/dojoengine/vibe-sample) for an example game vibe-coded with the help of Sensei.

As always, if you have any questions or need any support, head over to the **#game-jam** channel in the [Dojo Discord](https://discord.gg/tHezCAA4).

## Submitting

We end at midnight PST so that our west-coast friends won't miss any of the fun.

Submit your project before the deadline to qualify for the prizes:

-   Copy / Paste the [Game Jam Submission Template](./templates/SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md), follow the instructions, and open a Pull Request which contributes the submission to the repository.
-   Create a new file [`game-jam-7` directory](./game-jam-7) using the name of your project in `kebab-case` as the file name.

## Judging

Review and judging of projects will take place in the week after the game jam concludes. Judging is subjective, but it will be based on the criteria listed below.

1.  Novel use of the unique properties of the Dojo Engine.
2.  Originality of concept, game mechanics, visual design, etc.
3.  Compelling visual and game design.
4.  Level of fun!
