The Dojo Game Jam is back! This 72-hour weekend will bring together the Dojo ecosystem to build games on the open-source, provable Dojo Engine.

Prizes will be awarded to winning teams, but the goal of this game jam is to combine the efforts of those who share the vision of fully onchain games and to identify teams who are ready to build and ship!

If youâ€™re ready to get involved and find a team, introduce yourself in the Dojo Discord - new contributors are always welcome. From there, the Dojo Book is a great place to start your journey.

## Judging

Review and judging of projects will take place in the week after the game jam concludes. Judging is subjective, but it will be based on the criteria listed below.

1. Novel use of the unique properties of the Dojo Engine
2. Originality of concept, game mechanics, visual design, etc.
3. Compelling visual and game design
4. Level of fun

Judges will have final say over whether a project meets the criteria for a specific track as well as the amount of the prize pool to be allocated based on their subject assessment of the quality of the submission. All prize pools will not necessarily be fully awarded.
