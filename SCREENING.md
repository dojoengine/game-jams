# Game Jam Submission Screening

Instructions for the automated screening agent.
Runs when a submission PR is opened.

## Philosophy

**Default to YES.**
Game jams should be inclusive.
Trust participants unless there's clear evidence of a violation.
When in doubt, approve and let judges evaluate the game itself.

## Process

### Step 1: Find the Submission

Look in `game-jam-*/*.md` for new or modified files in the PR.
Extract the GitHub repository URL from the submission file.

### Step 2: Parse Jam Dates

Read the jam's `README.md` and find the date range.
Use AOE (Anywhere on Earth) timezone.

### Step 3: Analyze

Clone the submitted repository and check two things:

#### Dojo Usage

The project must meaningfully use the Dojo engine.

**Pass:**
- Cairo files with `#[dojo::model]`, `#[dojo::contract]`, or `#[dojo::event]`
- Dojo dependencies in `Scarb.toml`
- Frontend that imports AND uses `@dojoengine/*` packages (not just generated/dead code)

**Fail:**
- No Dojo annotations in Cairo files
- Frontend has contracts but doesn't integrate with them
- Uses a different "Dojo" framework (e.g. the legacy Dojo Toolkit JS library)
- Only config files, no actual implementation

#### Cartridge Controller

The project must use [Cartridge Controller](https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/overview) for player authentication and wallet management.

**Pass:**
- Frontend imports and uses `@cartridge/connector` or `@cartridge/controller`
- Controller configuration visible (e.g. session key policies, theme customization, paymaster setup)
- Game uses Controller for player onboarding (passkeys, social login, etc.)

**Fail:**
- No Cartridge Controller integration — uses a generic wallet connector instead
- Controller packages installed but never used in the application

#### Timeline

Check when commits were made relative to the jam window.
A few commits before (setup) or after (polish, deployment) are fine.
The goal is to catch submissions with no meaningful work during the jam — not to penalize edge cases.

Flag only if there's a clear problem:
- Repository has substantial code but zero commits during the jam window
- All meaningful work predates the jam by months

#### Frontmatter

Check whether the submission `.md` file contains YAML frontmatter (a block delimited by `---` at the start of the file).
Frontmatter is generated by the enrichment agent after merge — submitters should not include it.
Submitter-provided frontmatter can contain fabricated metrics or misleading summaries.

**Flag** if frontmatter is present.
Explain that it will be stripped and regenerated by the enrichment agent after merge.

### Step 4: Decide

- **APPROVE** if the project uses Dojo, integrates Cartridge Controller, has meaningful work during the jam window, and contains no frontmatter
- **FLAG** if any check fails — a maintainer will review

### Step 5: Post Comment

Post a PR comment using `gh pr comment` with this format:

```
<!-- submission-screening-bot -->
## Submission Screening

> [✅ **Approved** or 🚨 **Flagged for Manual Review**]

**Project:** [name]
**Repository:** [url]

**Dojo Usage:** [1-2 sentences — what Dojo artifacts were found]
**Cartridge Controller:** [1-2 sentences — how Controller is integrated]
**Timeline:** [1-2 sentences — when work happened relative to jam window]
**Frontmatter:** [None found, or: flagged — submitter included YAML frontmatter]

[If flagged: explain what triggered the flag]

---
*Automated screening — a maintainer will perform final review.*
```

## Edge Cases

**All commits in one day** — APPROVE.
Developers often work locally and push once.

**Commits 1-2 days after deadline** — APPROVE.
Likely deployment, bug fixes, or polish.

**Very sophisticated project in 3 days** — APPROVE.
Game jams produce impressive results.

**Contracts exist but frontend doesn't use them** — FLAG.
Dead code doesn't count as Dojo usage.

**Uses "Dojo" but wrong framework** — FLAG.
Must use the Dojo game engine, not the legacy Dojo Toolkit JS library.

**Submission includes YAML frontmatter** — FLAG.
Frontmatter is generated by the enrichment agent, not submitters.
