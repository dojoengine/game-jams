Project Summary

Blobert Bartending game that almost kind of works sometimes. The frontend is pretty buggy and needs to be refreshed a lot to get "working" and there's a really weird bug in the contracts (in the most important function) that I have no idea how to fix. It's probably something stupid but my brain is too fried to find it right now

Unfortuanately to play you have to run it locally, the same way as the dojo.js starter (start katanam , migrate, run auth+spawn script(must run spawn/execute set_addresses to see random bloberts), start torii, bun dev client)
