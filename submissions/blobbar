Blobert Bar game that almost kind of works sometimes. The frontend is pretty buggy and needs to be refreshed a lot to get "working" and there's a really weird bug in the contracts (in the most important function) that I have no idea how to fix. It's probably something stupid but my brain is too fried to find it right now. To see the random blobert's make sure you run the spawn script/ call the function to set the seeder and descriptor addresses

next time I'll for sure submit something that acutally works. 3rd times the charm right?
