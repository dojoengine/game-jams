### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.
DodgeBaller is a game built for Blobert NFT holders. It combines your Blobert's unique traits with a classic dodgeball challenge. Here's the gist:

**Mint a Dodgeball NFT**: Your Blobert's features like armor, weapon, and material transform into a one-of-a-kind Dodgeball NFT for the game.

**Earn Dodgecoin**: Minting a Dodgeball NFT also rewards you with some sweet Dogecoin!

**Sharpen Your Aim**: Launch cannonballs at a target, aiming for a bullseye. Each bullseye earns you a hefty amount of Dodgecoin.

**Dodge Financial Ruin**: Every throw costs you a small amount of Dodgecoin. Can you hit the target and become a wealthy Blobert?

It's a fun way to test your skills, win cryptocurrency, and celebrate the unique qualities of your Blobert NFT.
