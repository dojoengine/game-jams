# Moving Mountains With Yu

### Project Summary
> The inspiration for this game comes from a casual idle game on Steam: Cookie Clicker(https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454400/Cookie_Clicker/).

With the upgrades of 4844, the gas consumption has become extremely low. Moreover, if you use Katana for L3, the gas will be even lower. Thanks to Katana's fast on-chain speed, I did not use a record reading method in game design. All population increases are completed through chain interaction, which also conforms to the background setting of the game's story: "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains."

The gameplay involves producing offspring by clicking on houses. You can increase the number of offspring per click by consuming population upgrades or by purchasing totems (each totem consumes different populations for purchase and requires certain strategies for upgrades).

The unit of production is Blobert, which represents the population generated with each click. This is a virtual world, so there's no rigid generation of people.
