### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.

Blobert Bartending game that almost kind of works sometimes. The frontend is pretty buggy and needs to be refreshed a lot to get "working" and there's a really weird bug in the contracts (in the most important function) that I have no idea how to fix. It's probably something stupid but my brain is too fried to find it right now
