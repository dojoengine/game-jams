### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.
Have you ever owned a soccer team, now you truly can with ZoKer.
ZoKer lets you build your dream team blockchain frictionless powered by Dojo, Controller and Paymaster. Unleash your inner Pep Guardiola in the first fully onchain football manager game! Jump in through Telegram and show us your tactics! Ready to become the greatest manager in the chain? ZoKer is not only a soccer manager game but a community driven project based on one of the most unpredictable games on human history. With millions of fans soccer is one of the most not only sports played but video games too. Our project is not based only on PvP matches but in season tournaments, an inside market with players, trainers and professionals, stadiums, sponsors, etc. An entire ecosystem will be born from the game. 
We believe that current on-chain options don’t really push a sustainable community part therefor they rely more on exposition and speculation. Current soccer manager games don’t really focus on rewarding the community or the lack of deep and strategy reward system. Blockchain will allow players to truly own their teams and focus on winning and wet rewarded. Allowing not only sustainable business model with the controller and the Paymaster but to add web3 business models to inject again value in community treasure.  Massive user adoption is one step closer with a game not needed to study. This is not about understanding complex concepts but to play as you’ve always done, having fun, easily, but this time generating value. Spanish and English soccer fans will be out first target. Like Europe and SouthAmerica.

### Submission Tracks
> Provide a list of the tracks your project is submitting to. Provide each track on a new line.
Provide a list of tracks here!
‘Road to Mainnet’: We plan to push the project as far as possible involving all the community and open-source contributors. The roadmap to Mainnet should be done by the next three months at least for our minimal PvP mode. Every teammate has other responsibilities but support will help to speed up every process of the game.
‘New World’: This is a new team, new project and new world. Soccer games are indeed a race where we better start early.
‘Hidden information’: Players will actively decide shooting direction on every goal opportunity, and goalkeepers will have to guess but this is HI. Also formations shouldn’t be shown to adversaries until the game starts so they cannot anticipate results. We’ll also use Cartridge VRF for the coin flip.
‘RTC’: community will be strong and we want to engage emotionally during the game, that’s why we will add emojis (clash Royale like) to taunt and express their feelings
