# Depths of Dread

### Project Summary

Top-down roguelike game with pixel art and dungeon environments.

The player will receive a code/hint in the beginning of each level that they will need to memorize to complete the floor.

The level floor will be obscured and filled with traps and enemies awaiting to defeat the player. If defeated, the player progress will be reset.

Scattered through the level there will be also treasures to be collected which will improve the run score if collected.
