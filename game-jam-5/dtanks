DTanks is a deceptive tank warfare game where players command a mix of 6 real tanks and 6 dummy decoys. Victory requires both combat skill and clever misdirection as players battle to reach 1,500 points first, using terrain and strategic deception to keep opponents guessing which tanks are real and which are fake.
