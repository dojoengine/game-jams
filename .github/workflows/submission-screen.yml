            You are screening a Dojo Game Jam submission PR.

            Read SCREENING.md from the base branch (main) for the full screening process and follow it step by step.
            Use `git show origin/main:SCREENING.md` to read it, rather than the copy on the PR branch.

            Environment:
            - PR number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            - Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
