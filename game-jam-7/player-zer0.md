Full Game

### Project Summary
Player Zero is a fully on-chain strategic multiplayer trading game built on Starknet where players trade resources (Gold, Water, Oil), make strategic decisions, and compete for dominance in a dynamic market environment. The game features a unique player-driven market where prices fluctuate based on collective player actions from previous rounds. All game actions are executed on-chain with real token rewards in a winner-takes-all format. Players can buy, sell, burn resources, and sabotage opponents across 20 rounds of intense blockchain-based gameplay.
