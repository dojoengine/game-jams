## Submission Track
**Full Game(Dojo Jam VII)**

## Project Summary

**StarkChess** is a fully on-chain chess experience built on **Starknet**, powered by the **Dojo Engine**, and integrated with **Cartridge** for seamless gameplay.

It transforms traditional chess into a game of **trust, value, and verifiable skill**, where every move and decision is recorded on-chain. Players can compete in **PvP** or **PvC** modes, with all actions being transparent and immutable.

Beyond gameplay, **Spectator Prediction Staking** lets users stake tokens on match outcomes, blending chess strategy with DeFi incentives.

With a sleek interface and on-chain logic, StarkChess redefines chess as a decentralized, fair, and rewarding gaming experience.
