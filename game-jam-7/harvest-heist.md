# Harvest Heist

### Submission Track
New Game

### Project Summary

**HarvestHeist** is a roguelike heist adventure where players infiltrate **procedurally generated banks** to steal loot, dodge traps, and escape before the **timer** runs out.  
Loot is only permanent if you **return to the safe zone** before time expires — fail, and everything is lost.

---

## **Core Flow**
1. **Enter Bank** – Explore randomized rooms with traps, loot, and enemies.  
2. **Collect Loot** – Accumulate unbanked loot; higher rooms = higher risk.  
3. **Return to Safe Area** – Timer still ticking; retrace path through hazards.  
4. **Secure Loot** – Reach safe zone to bank loot permanently.  
5. **Upgrade & Prepare** – Spend loot on upgrades, gadgets, or staking rewards.
