# Kanoodle Fusion

### Project Summary
Kanoodle Fusion is a blockchain-based puzzle game built on Starknet using the Dojo framework. Players solve color-mixing puzzles by placing translucent polyomino pieces on a 4x4 grid, where colors stack and blend additively to match target patterns. The game features 50 progressively challenging levels, with all game state and logic stored on-chain.

The game implements a unique color-mixing mechanic where primary colors (red, yellow, blue) combine to create secondary colors (orange, green, purple), creating an engaging puzzle experience that requires both spatial reasoning and color theory understanding.
