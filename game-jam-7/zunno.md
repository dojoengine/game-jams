Phase One (β.v.01): Decentralized On-Chain Gameplay

This first phase establishes the foundation of decentralized UNO gameplay:

   - Client-Side Application
    React-based frontend enabling players to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts

   - On-Chain Game State Management
    All game sessions, player participation, hands, moves, and results are recorded on-chain for transparency

   - Smart Contract on Starknet
    Dojo contracts manage the global and historical game state, ensuring no centralized authority controls gameplay

   - Server-Assisted Card Distribution
    Initial randomness and card shuffling handled by Rust backend services using cryptographically secure random number generation
