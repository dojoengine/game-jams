# Need For Bits

### Submission Track
> Full game
### Project Summary
> Need for Bits is a racing game inspired from the all time blockbuster Need For Speed with some inspiration from POW from Starknet, where your car is your validator node and speed equals hash rate. After Razor, leader of a malicious node cartel, destroys your elite GENESIS node with a 51% attack, you must climb through six increasingly difficult opponents—each controlling different blockchain technologies from basic transactions to DeFi protocols. Battle through mempool races, block mining sprints, and smart contract duels to reclaim your node and defeat Razor's L2 empire in the ultimate consensus showdown.
