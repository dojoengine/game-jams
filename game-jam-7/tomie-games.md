### Overview

**TOMIE GAMES** is a fully on-chain, narrative-driven *Rock, Paper, Scissors* experience built on **Starknet** with the **Dojo** framework.  
Face off against *Tomie* in a short but intense psychological battle of luck, ego, and chance.

### ✦ What Makes It Special
- **Classic Mechanics, Twisted Context:** A fresh take on *Rock, Paper, Scissors* with a life-based duel system.  
- **Narrative-Driven:** Dynamic dialogues and voice-acted lines that react to each match.  
- **Expressive Character:** Tomie’s expressions shift depending on the outcome — mocking, angry, or calm.  
- **Life System:** Both start with 3 lives. First to lose them all… loses more than just the game.  
- **Fully On-Chain:** Every action, choice, and result is stored transparently through Dojo models.  
- **Cinematic Transitions:** Smooth fades and animated phases between rounds.  


### How to Play

   Launch the game and link your wallet.

2. **Start a New Game**  
   Accept Tomie Kawakami invitation and take your seat at the table.  

3. **Gameplay Loop**
   - **Dialogue Phase:** Text appears gradually with typewriter animation. Click to skip or speed up.  
   - **Choice Phase:** Choose *Rock*, *Paper*, or *Scissors*. Each move is recorded on-chain.  
   - **Result Phase:** Watch the reveal — Tomie’s reactions are unpredictable and animated.  
   - **Win / Lose / Draw:**  
     - You win → Tomie loses a life.  
     - You lose → One of your lives disappears.  
     - Draw → Nothing changes, tension builds.  

4. **Endings**  
   Unique dialogues for each outcome, full voice sync, and cinematic fade-outs to victory or defeat screens.

Most of the artwork is inspired by the works of **Junji Ito**.  
His art completely changed the way I see horror storytelling — and this project is my small tribute to that impact.
