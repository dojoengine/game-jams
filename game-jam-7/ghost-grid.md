# Ghost Grid

### Submission Track
New Game

### Project Summary
Ghost Grid is a Phasmophobia-inspired, provable on-chain ghost-hunting game on Starknet (Sepolia) built with Dojo.  
Runs, evidence, and scores are written on-chain; a Torii indexer powers player profiles and a leaderboard.  
React + Vite frontend uses Cartridge session keys so players don’t sign every action.  
Planned next: bigger maps, co-op, and (actually working) leaderboard.
