### Project Summary

Simula is a fully onchain 8-bit city builder civilization game on Starknet where players claim plots, construct buildings, and manage resources in real-time. Players can build gold mines, energy plants, water extractors, habitats, and iron mines that generate resources passively based on elapsed time. The game uses a two-layer architecture: instant client-side feedback with localStorage persistence for seamless gameplay, and blockchain validation for security and permanent state storage. There is room in the future to add battle mechanics and more advanced graphics.
