### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.

Charon is a space combat game where players either create rescue missions or attempt to complete them. Creators place a target ship on a grid and surround it with enemy ships and defenses, then set entry fees and rewards - they earn credits when rescuers fail and lose credits when rescuers succeed. Rescuers choose their ship, pay the entry fee, and navigate through the defenses to reach the target ship and claim the reward. The game creates a competitive ecosystem where creators design increasingly clever challenges while rescuers develop better skills and equipment, with leaderboards tracking both mission design quality and rescue success rates.
