### Submission Track

Full Game

### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.

The prototype of Craft Island had basic mechanics before the weekend but one key aspect of the game was missing: island exploration.

With your flying ship, you can access procedurally generated islands to gather new resources.

You can explore an island up to 5 times to find new resources behind the fog.

Other aspects of the game updated:
- Unique resources added in generated islands
- Onboarding quests to guide the player
- Mobile controls
- First TestFlight demo

#### How I used AI

ART

The flying ship is a 2D image made with ChatGPT that I then transformed into a 3D model with [Rodin AI](https://hyper3d.ai/).

The quality is good and it's cheap so I will definitely use it again to prototype things quickly before bringing an artist onboard to unify everything.

CODE

I used Claude Code in my terminal and also Zed AI (with Claude 4) to make all the contracts changes.

I also moved some UE5 Blueprint code to C++ files so that the AI can help me. This is the beginning as I want to move most of the mechanic in C++ to leverage AI.
