# Detective Game

### Project Summary

**Detective Game** is a blockchain-first murder mystery where players interrogate AI-powered suspects to solve a crime. Each session allows a single accusation, with the outcome recorded on Starknet using Dojo smart contracts.

The game uses a hybrid architecture: fully onchain logic for game state, and GPT-generated suspect dialogue handled off-chain. All major game actions â€” game start, accusations, and player stats â€” are recorded and indexed onchain, with UI and gameplay enhanced through a custom React + Tailwind frontend.

Built solo over the 72-hour jam window, the project demonstrates how expressive AI and provable Dojo game mechanics can work together to deliver engaging, replayable mystery gameplay.
