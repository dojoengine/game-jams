#### Game Description

Elven Escape is an adventure game where players embark on a fun journey through a mystical forest seeking escape. As you traverse this dangerous world step by step, you'll encounter ancient shrines offering powerful blessings and cosmetic rewards, face formidable gatekeepers in combat, and navigate deadly traps that test your survival instincts.
