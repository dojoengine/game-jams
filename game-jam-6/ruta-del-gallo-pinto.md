"Ruta del Gallo Pinto" is a 2D digital board game set in the heart of Costa Rica. Players take on the role of charming dog chefs, navigating a grid-based world to collect essential ingredients like rice, beans, cilantro, and the iconic Salsa Lizano. The objective is to be the first to craft traditional Costa Rican recipes, such as the famous Gallo Pinto and the hearty Casado. The game is built with a React frontend and powered by the Dojo Engine and Cartridge for its on-chain game logic.
