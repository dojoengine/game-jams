# Overgoal: More Than a Match

### Submission Track

> Full Game

### Project Summary

> Overgoal drops you into the boots—and life—of a rising football legend. Matches play out in snappy, arcade-style sequences, while off-field choices (endorsements, nightlife, training) reshape your stats and storyline. Every decision is stored on-chain, so your player’s history is provably yours and can carry into future titles in the Over universe. ⚽️📈
