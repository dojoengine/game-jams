### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.

Ponzi Land is a high-stakes, strategically chaotic game where deception, risk, and clever maneuvers dictate your survival. In this world, players must outsmart, outlast, and out-Ponzi each other to claim ultimate dominance. Whether you're a seasoned schemer or a fresh recruit, these docs will guide you through the intricate web of mechanics that define Ponzi Land.

### Play
> Provide instructions on how to play your game. It could be a URL, a README, or a link to a binary to install.

Connect Your Wallet – You'll need a Starknet-compatible wallet.
Acquire Land – You can either:
Buy land in a Dutch auction (new land sales).
Buy land from another player who has listed it for sale.
List Your Land for Sale – Every land you buy must be listed for sale.
You set the sale price and choose any ERC-20 token for the listing.
The chosen token must be paired with a liquid token (LORDS, STRK, ETH).
Understand the Tax System – Your tax rate is based on the sale price you set:
A percentage (2%) of your sale price is taxed per day.
The tax is paid in the same token you list the land for.
The 8 neighboring tiles receive the tax.
Stay Liquid or Lose Your Land – If your land runs out of staked tokens, it gets reclaimed and re-auctioned.
