**You Are Who You Kill** is a Frankenstein-style web3 game where you build your body from the enemies you defeat.  
Each part gives stat bonuses - HP, Damage, or Mobility â€” and builds your unique character.  
Built solo with Dojo, featuring two playable demo levels, basic turn-based PvE combat, obstacles, and inventory.  
Long-term vision includes PvP, modular NFT body parts, and cross-game interoperability.
