### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.
Golem Runner is a visually stunning, mobile-first endless runner where players control elemental golems racing through vibrant, mystical realms. 

For this Game Jam, we built an innovative AI-Powered Daily Missions System that showcases the cutting-edge integration of AI agents with on-chain gaming:

🤖 AI Mission Generation: We integrated an Eliza AI Agent that dynamically generates personalized daily missions for players. The AI creates contextual challenges based on different golems, worlds, and gameplay objectives, ensuring fresh content every day.

⛓️ On-Chain Mission Persistence: All missions generated by the AI are stored directly in our Dojo contracts, creating a permanent, verifiable record of challenges and ensuring data integrity across sessions.

🎮 Dynamic Game Logic Integration: We implemented sophisticated game logic that automatically tracks mission progress during gameplay. When players complete runs, the system validates mission completion against predefined criteria (coins collected, specific worlds/golems used) and updates the contract state accordingly.

🏆 Reward System: Players can claim rewards directly from completed missions through smart contract interactions
