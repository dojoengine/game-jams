Full Game

### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.
Casual word puzzle strategy game. Players take turns chaining letters on a hex grid into valid words. If a valid word is submitted, the tiles are "captured" and can not be used by the opposition. Form a complete hexagon with yours or your opponents tiles to lock the central tile, and earn a point for the **majority** holder. Once a hexagon core is locked, all surrounding hexagon tile letters are reset randomly. First to the score limit wins. It's not just about finding the longest word, but also about strategic maneuvering.
